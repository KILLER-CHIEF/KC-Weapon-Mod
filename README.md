This mod allows users and mod makers to easily create any kind of projectile launching weapon they can dream of (and design themselves by using this mod).

These custom weapons can be made and implemented in one of two ways:
- Create an XML file (will eventually be automated) containing the weapon's function specifications and file paths to resources (Textures and Sounds), 
- Mod makers can code the weapons properties and call a function in the mod with a parameter containing an array of the properties of all the weapons they wish to register.
